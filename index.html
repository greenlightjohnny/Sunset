                <p> District 7 is an awesome location. Many people choose to live here instead of District 1 due to the cheaper housing costs. The roads here are bigger, there is less traffic, and overall much more peace and quite. It's a good balance between living in super busy District 1 and living on the outskirts.</p>

                <h3>The Neighborhood <i class="fas fa-home"></i></h3>
                <p>The street is technically a dead end, it ends up against the river. It is, however, a large area with a few other smaller upperclass housing devolopments. The area is extremely safe, I have not met a single person who has had any kind of problem.</p>

                <h3>Commute <i class="fas fa-traffic-light"></i></h3>
                <p>There are a growing number of people who live in District 7 and commute to District 1 for work. Before you commit to doing this, I recommend you drive the route from the apartment to your work during both morning and afternoon rush hour traffic. Needless to say, Vietnamese traffic is a thing to experience and not for everyone.</p>

                <h2>Life <i class="fas fa-list-ul"></i></h2>
                <p>So what's it like living here? It's a massive complex with over 10 buildings reaching 24 stories high, with more on the way. Here is a sample of what daily life was like for me</p>
            </article>
            </div>
            <div class="flex3">
            <aside class="gym">
                    <h3>Lift <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i></h3>
                    <p>The main reason I decided to live here!
                        The gym is awesome, all new with lots of room to expand later.
                        Most importantly, they have a power rack. It's a quality gym.
                        It is located on the ground floor, next to the pool. The gym hours are unknown. I've worked out as late as 11pm and been asked to leave at 9pm other times. Sometimes the front desk is manned, sometimes it is not.

            <aside class="swim">
                    <h3>Swim <i class="fas fa-swimmer"></i></h3>
                    <p>Yes, it has a pool! Located in the center of the complex, it is outdoors and sorrounded by the complex. Though it is very big, it is not deep. With a max depth of about four feet you won't be doing any diving. Right now there are only about 10 poolside lounge chairs, hopefully they will be getting more. </p>
                </aside>

                <aside class="Security">
                        <h3>Security. Parking <i class="fas fa-parking"></i></h3>
                        <p>Security is all over. Guards patrolling all day, cameras everywhere. You have to use your key card to enter the lobby and use the elevator. You can only go to your floor, parking, or the lobby. Parking is underground and has a 24/7 booth attendant. Make sure to ask if your apartment comes with a car parking spot, motorcycle, or both.</p>

                            <h3>Shop. Eat <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i></h3>
                            <p>Because the complex is probably not even 10% inhabited currently, there are not that many shops on the ground floor yet. Just a coffee shop and some offices. For food and a supermarket you will have to walk about 10 minutes to the New Saigon apartment complex. Two huge malls are about 8 minutes motorbike away as well.</p>
                            <p>As the complex begins to fill up I am confident that some awesome Pho resturants will open, so you won't even have to leave for food. In the meantime, Grab delivers for super cheap, about .80 cents.</p>

                            Saving the most important for last. Internet has been decent, running at around 35Mbps (4.4MBps) both up and down. Not the fastest but good enough for Skype video calls and Netflix. It has been reliable, only dropping about once every two weeks for a few minutes. I have a SIM card hotspot just case though, and I strongly recommend you get one if you rely on the internet for you work.

                        <h3>The Bad <i class="far fa-frown"></i></h2>
                        <p>The number one thing you should be aware of is construction noise. Even though the buildings are totally finished from the exterior, it does not mean each apartment is ready to move in. Most are currently just bare concrete shells. When someone buys an apartment they have the interior built just how they want. So you could be living on a nice floor but the apartments around you are not finished, and if they decide to finish the interior you are going to be hearing it all day long for the next two months. There is no way of knowing when this will happen. Even if you are in one of the older buildings, remodeling is so cheap that a new owner will often have it completely redone. </p>

                Here is where things get fuzzy. Apartments are not rented out directly by the company, instead individuals or other companies buy them and in turn rent them out to others. So there is not set pricings whatsever. Generally, you will be looking at $550 - 800$ a months for at two bedroom apartment. Up to $1,100 for a three bedroom. The price will change depending on the length of your rental, how the apartment is furnished, and the view.

                <p>
                    You will need to pay for water and electric, check to see if internet is included or not. Water is super cheap, my first month's bill came to under $9 with two people living there. Electric is a bit more, my bill was $98 for the month of April. This was due to having at least one A/C going nearly 24/7, sometimes all three A/C units. You could get by with cheaper by opening the balcony door at night or using a fan. If you are not home during the day it would be cheaper as well.

            <p>I found my apartment through an agent that I found on a Facebook group. My landlord pays her a commision to find tenants. If you have decided on this apartment it is easier to go directly through the landlord, and likely a bit cheaper. Here is the contact info for my landlord, she had a many apartments at Sunrise available and has been awesome!</p>
